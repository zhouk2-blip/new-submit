    <div class="poem">
        <p class="hidden">In another moment the pale<br>
        stars alone were visible.</p>
        <p class="hidden">I was getting confounded<br>
        stuffy and tired by this time--I must have been down twenty-five minutes<br>
        or more--and I thought this was good enough.</p>

        <p class="hidden">The <em>Shipping and Mercantile Gazette</em>, the <em>Lloyd’s List</em>,<br>
        the <em>Packet-Boat</em>, and the <em>Maritime and Colonial Review</em>, all<br>
        papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their<br>
        rates of premium, were unanimous on this point.</p>

        <p class="hidden">That's what they call us, the natives,<br>
        I mean.</p>

        <p class="hidden">I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One<br>
        Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions<br>
        produces a Square.</p>

        <p class="hidden">"Major?"</p>

        <p class="hidden">Hendricks pushed the curtain back.<br>
        After a week or so chasing<br>
        about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be<br>
        caught cheerful.</p>

        <p class="hidden">Let me draw one last picture before I close the<br>
        notebook--a picture which is the last memory of the old country which I<br>
        bear away with me.</p>

        <p class="hidden">The big ferryboat<br>
        had just made a journey.</p>

        <p class="hidden">WORSFOLD<br>
        SOUTH AFRICA: Its History and its Future.</p>

        <p class="hidden">But I had done with the world on the day when my <em>Nautilus</em><br>
        plunged for the first time beneath the waters.</p>

        <p class="hidden">Its teeth were little, but devilish sharp, and its jaw could<br>
        not have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my<br>
        ankle."</p>

        <p class="hidden">"It has pretty nearly," said Thaddy.</p>

        <p class="hidden">"It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely.<br>
        Like all other students, I<br>
        delighted in tobacco; and, seating myself in the great armchair, I began<br>
        to think.</p>

        <p class="hidden">Where was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some<br>
        solitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with<br>
        his cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics.</p>

        <p class="hidden">At this period the earth sloped<br>
        downwards; the light took a uniform tint.<br>
        The Professor looked at me, and<br>
        there was something humorous at the back of his eyes.</p>

        <p class="hidden">"Come in!" said he.<br>
        I wish to hide nothing of our position from<br>
        you--”</p>

        <p class="hidden">“And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” replied the reporter, with<br>
        animation.</p>

        <p class="hidden">Then<br>
        their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.</p>

        <p class="hidden">“Good-bye, till we meet again,” cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in<br>
        such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb<br>
        could not help laughing.</p>

        <p class="hidden">The ascent was continued.<br>
        Said he often saw you by moonlight hovering over<br>
        the crests out towards the Shendu country.--Confound it, man!"</p>

        <p class="hidden">The lieutenant laughed cheerfully.<br>
        The top<br>
        side of it's three hundred degrees."</p>

        <p class="hidden">"Three hundred degrees!" said Raut.</p>

        <p class="hidden">"Three hundred centigrade, mind!" said Horrocks.<br>
        And these<br>
        few days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking<br>
        the vessel, and launching her.</p>
